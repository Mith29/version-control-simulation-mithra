I created "Version-control-simulation-mithra" folder in my local. And initiated with a "index.html" file. 
Added boilerplate in the index file and committed it to the main branch.
Created 2 different branches to add header and footer parts.
I merged one of them with the main branch. I made some changes in the footer part of the main branch and when I tried to merge the footer branch with the main,there was some conflicts. I resolved the conflict and merged them.
Now I created the repository in my github and pushed the main branch from my local to it.
And then I created the review/main branch and created pull request. Did some changes in the review/main branch and merged it with the main branch without any conflicts.
